My name is Dimitris Sikeridis and I am a Ph.D. candidate at the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](http://www.ece.unm.edu/), [University of New Mexico](http://www.unm.edu/), since August 2016. My advisor is professor [Michael Devetsikiotis](http://www.ece.unm.edu/faculty-staff/electrical-and-computer/michael-devetsikiotis.html) and I am a member of the UNM Internet of Things Lab. 

In July 2016, I obtained my Diploma in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](http://www.ece.upatras.gr/index.php/en/) from the [University of Patras](http://www.upatras.gr/en). My Diploma Thesis was supervised by professor Theodore Antonakopoulos at the Laboratory of Electrotechnics, [Cognitive Computing Machines and Embedded Systems (COMES) Group](http://www.loe.ee.upatras.gr/English/COMES-home.htm).
